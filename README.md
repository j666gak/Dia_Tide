# Dia_Tide
A Python script to convert Diasend export and upload in to Tidepool.org
 <p>
## Full Description
Over the past number of years I have accumalated a number of different blood testing meters, and each one requires it own software to download results. Then Diasend.com (used by various hospitals) have a portal that includes and Uploader including driver for most Blood Glucose Meters, which makes it extremely useful however the graphs and analysis tools (in my personal opinion) could use some improvement. At this point I came across an Opensource project Tidepool.org which among other things have good analytic and graph capabilities, but currently limited to only two specific BGM's. Therefore this script is to bridge the gap between the number of devices that Diasend can communicate with, and the analytical capabilities of Tidepool.

 I hope you find this as useful as I have.
